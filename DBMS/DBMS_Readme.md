# Database Management System
* Here we will be dealing mostly with Relational Database (Table Based)






### Mostly to learn (Hard Topics to Understand and Cover)
* 1. Normalization (Closure, Anomaly, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)
    * Important is not making notes. but keep on revising and understanding for once and all, If you are not using in your practical in Software development
    * then it will be hard to remember this topics, so keep links here and extra you can add for your understanding and able to understand others
    * Topic A1 : Closure of attributes in DBMS (Closure)
    * link for Closure topic A1 : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/explain-closure-of-attributes-in-dbms#:~:text=Closure%20of%20an%20attribute%20x,means%20what%20X%20can%20determine.
    * Just do some practise, but do learn this only when you get selected for interview and they require/include SQL/DBMS interview also
    * Topic A2 : Functional Dependency
    * link for Functional Dependency topic A2 : https://www.guru99.com/dbms-functional-dependency.html
    * Topic A3 : Normal Form ( 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)
    * this topic is tough, no one in interview is going to ask you above 2NF.
    * best way to learn is youtube at that time before interview
    * Notes won't be able to help you at just moment
    * links for learning Normal Forms (Youtube Playlist on Normal Form ) : Studytonight channel, Normal forms 
    * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoTyrdT9SZI&list=PLLGlmW7jT-nTr1ory9o2MgsOmmx2w8FB3&ab_channel=StudytonightwithAbhishek
* 2. Index (Clustered and Non Clustered)
    * If you learn and understand it and can explain to others and can use it practically in your software then only it is good, else link is present below
    * Topic A1 : Index (Clustered and Non-Clustered)
    * Link : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/indexes?view=sql-server-ver16
    * Link : https://www.javatpoint.com/sql-index
    * Topic A2 : Difference between clustered and non-clustered index
    * Link : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-clustered-and-non-clustered-index/
    * Topic A3 : Tips to Increase SQL Server Query Performance
    * Link (Check both Part 1 and Part 2) : https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/f0b2ed/tips-to-increase-sql-server-query-performance-part-1/
* 3. ACID Properties




### SQL Queries Learning
* Different Servers and Different Top Up SQL Language
* SQL Server (Database) | Uses T-SQL | Owner is Microsoft
* MySQL Server (Database) | User P-SQL | Owner is Oracle
* and so on




### Interview Based Learning Topics
* Try to cover all topics in interview and practise only those which you don't understand
* This is when you get for interview round
